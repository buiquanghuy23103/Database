\intro{DATABASE}{Subqueries}
\section{Subqueries}
A subquery is a complete SELECT statement embedded within another SELECT statement. The results of this \emph{inner} SELECT statement  (or \emph{subselect}) are used in the outer statement to help determine the contents of the final results. A subselect can be used in the WHERE and HAVING clauses of an outer SELECT statement, where it is called a \emph{subquery} or \emph{nested query}. There are three types of subquery:
\begin{itemize}
\item A \emph{scalar subquery} returns a single column and a single row, that is, a single value (Listing \ref{scalar-subquery}).
\item A \emph{row subquery} returns multiple columns, but only a single row.
\item A \emph{table subquery} returns multiple columns and multiple rows. A table subquery can be used as an operand for the IN predicate.
\end{itemize}
\begin{listing}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sql,style=cool]
SELECT staffNo, fName, lName, position
FROM Staff
WHERE branchNo =(SELECT branchNo
     		FROM Branch
     		WHERE street = '163 Main St' );
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{A scalar subquery}\label{scalar-subquery}
\end{listing}
We can think of the subquery as producing a temporary table with results that can be accessed and used by the outer statement. The subquery itself is always enclosed in parentheses.
