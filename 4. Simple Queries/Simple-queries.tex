\section{Query in SQL}
The purpose of this article is to lay out the basic structure and use of SQL SELECT queries and statements. These statements are part of Transact-SQL (T-SQL) language specification and are central to the use of Microsoft SQL Server.\par 
Once we have data in the database, we want to look at the data and analyze it in an endless number of different ways, constantly varying the filtering, sorting, and calculations that we apply to the raw data. The SQL SELECT statement is what we use to choose, or select, the data that we want returned from the database to our application.
\subsection{The SELECT ... FROM clause}
The most basic SELECT statement has only 2 parts: (1) what columns you want to return and (2) what table(s) those columns come from. If we want to retrieve all of the information about all of the customers in the Employees table, we could use the asterisk (*) as a shortcut for all of the columns, and our query looks like
\begin{lstlisting}
	SELECT * FROM Employees
\end{lstlisting}
If we want only specific columns (as is usually the case), we can/should explicitly specify them in a comma-separated list, as in
\begin{lstlisting}
	SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate, City FROM Employees
\end{lstlisting}
which results in the specified fields of data for all of the rows in the table:
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1]{example.png}
	\caption{Select multiple columns}
	\end{figure}
 
\subsection{The WHERE clause}
The next thing we want to do is to start limiting, or filtering, the data we fetch from the database. By adding a WHERE clause to the SELECT statement, we add one (or more) conditions that must be met by the selected data. This will limit the number of rows that answer the query and are fetched. In many cases, this is where most of the "action" of a query takes place. We can continue with our previous query, and limit it to only those employees living in London:
\begin{lstlisting}
	SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate, City FROM Employees
	WHERE City = 'London'
	\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1]{WhereClause.png}
	\caption{List all employees living in London using WHERE clause}
	\end{figure}

\subsection{The ORDER BY clause}
Until now, we have been discussing filtering the data: that is, defining the conditions that determine which rows will be included in the final set of rows to be fetched and returned from the database. Once we have determined which columns and rows will be included in the results of our SELECT query, we may want to control the order in which the rows appearâ€”sorting the data. To sort the data rows, we include the ORDER BY clause. The ORDER BY clause includes one or more column names that specify the sort order. If we return to one of our first SELECT statements, we can sort its results by City with the following statement:
\begin{lstlisting}
	SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate, City FROM Employees
	ORDER BY City
	\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1]{Order.png}
	\caption{Sort results by City}
	\end{figure}

\subsection{The GROUP BY clause}
The GROUP BY clause groups the SELECT statement results according to the values in a list of one or more column expressions. For example, consider the Sales table ().\\
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
	\hline 
	\textbf{Country} & \textbf{Region} & \textbf{Sales} \\ 
	\hline 
	Canada & Alberta & 100 \\ 
	\hline 
	Canada & British Columbia & 200 \\ 
	\hline 
	Canada & British Columbia & 300 \\ 
	\hline 
	United States & Montana & 100 \\ 
	\hline 
	\end{tabular} \\
This next query groups Country and Region and returns the aggregate sum for each combination of values. 
\begin{lstlisting}
	SELECT Country, Region, SUM(sales) AS TotalSales
	FROM Sales
	GROUP BY Country, Region;
	\end{lstlisting}
The GROUP BY clause also interacts with other statements, such as COUNT, AVG, HAVING. As for HAVING clause, it searchs condition for a group or an aggregate. COUNT returns the number of items in a group. And AVG returns the average of the values in a group. 

\section{Practical part}
